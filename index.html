		<p> <i> This work investigated how early-life penicillin exposure affects the processing of sensory information both on the behavioral and the neurobiological level. On the behavioral level, it identified abnormalities in sensory as well as sensory-motor gating behaviors. On the neurobiological level, it identified changes in the development of inhibitory circuits as well as the morphology and process dynamics of microglia in the sensory processing region of the cerebral cortex. This work also explored how perturbations to the community structure of gut microbiota and changes in inflammatory signaling might mediate the identified behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. </i> </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Developed both fluorescent and DAB IHC protocols as well as wide field imaging protocols to measure neuronal and glial density differences between conditions </li>
			<li> Developed a fluorescent IHC protocol, a confocal imaging protocol, as well as a semiautomated analysis pipeline in Bitplane Imaris to measure morphological differences in microglia between different conditions </li>
			<li> Developed a semiautomated analysis pipeline in Bitplane Imaris to measure differences in microglial cell dynamics between conditions </li>
			<li> Purified total RNA from cerebral cortex tissue, synthesized cDNA, and performed RT-qPCRs to quantify differences in expression for a number of genes between conditions and ages </li>
			<li> Purified bacterial DNA, developed and performed a 16S library preparation protocol for Illumina 2x300bp MiSeq sequencing runs, and performed data analysis to characterize microbiome differences between conditions </li>
			<li> Performed a battery of behavioral assays </li>
			<li> Performed data management, analysis (Shapiro-Wilks normality test, Studentâ€™s t-test, 2-way ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney U test), and visualization in Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism </li>
			<li> Mentored undergraduate students, supported and collaborated with other graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and PIs </li>
			<li> Wrote, reviewed, and submitted grant proposals and manuscripts </li>
