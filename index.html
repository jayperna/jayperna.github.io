		<p> <i> This work investigated how early-life/perinatal penicillin exposure (PPE) affects the processing of sensory information both on the behavioral and the neurobiological level. On the behavioral level, it identified abnormalities in sensory as well as sensory-motor gating behaviors. On the neurobiological level, it identified changes in the development of inhibitory circuits as well as the morphology and process dynamics of microglia in the sensory processing region of the cerebral cortex. This work also explored changes in inflammatory signaling as well as the community structure of microbiota as potential mechanisms mediating behavioral perturbations. </i> </p>
